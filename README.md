# ðŸ§  Script Overview
This script performs three main tasks:

Most Common Words
- It analyzes a collection of blog texts to identify the 10 most frequently occurring words.

Word Similarity
- It computes and displays the 50 most similar pairs of words based on their embeddings or context.

Dollar Amount Extraction

After completing these tasks, a Streamlit web app is launched to display the results along with visualizations for additional tasks.
